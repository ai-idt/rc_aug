# Random Convolutions improve domain generalization of segmentation models

Accompanying code for our manuscript "Random Convolutions improve domain generalization of segmentation models".

In our paper, we evaluate the potential of random convolutions as a novel augmentation strategy to improve domain generalizability by inducing a shape bias in a medical image segmentation model.
We show that this strategy allows an abdominal organ segmentation model, trained on CT images, to translate without any further fine-tuning also to MR images, outperforming conventionally trained models and TotalSegmentator.

Our work translates the findings from the paper ["Progressive Random Convolutions for Single Domain Generalization"](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Choi_Progressive_Random_Convolutions_for_Single_Domain_Generalization_CVPR_2023_paper.html) by Choi _et al._ to the medical domain.
